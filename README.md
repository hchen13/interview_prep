# Google Interview Preparation Plan

This document is served as and overview and an action plan aimed at preparing for the Google's SWE role interview. The contents to be covered are derived from Google's official guide, a.k.a. [OG](OG.pdf). 

## Algorithms

Algorithms to be covered includes:

1. [The big-O notations](algorithms/big_o_notation.ipynb)
2. [divide and conquer](algorithms/divide_and_conquer.ipynb)
3. insertion sort
4. heapsort
5. quicksort
6. radix sort
7. bucket sort
8. dynamic programming/memoization
9. greedy
10. recursion
11. Dijkstra
12. A*
13. P vs. NP vs. NP-complete

## Data structures

The OG mentioned "be prepared to study up on as many data structures as possible". That's a lot of contents covered, due to the time constraint, the current plan is to cover basic data structures mentioned in the OG first, then all the data structures that are introduced in *Introduction to Algorithms*. Should also cover algorithms that link to or tend to go well with a specific data structure.

### In the OG
1. array
2. linked list
3. stack
4. queue
5. hash-set
6. hash-map
7. hash-table
8. dictionary
9. tree/binary tree
10. heap

### In *Introduction to Algorithms*

1. binary search tree
2. red-black tree

## Mathematics

The OG mentioned that math questions will be asked during the interviews, specifically discrete math. Thus the plan:

1. discrete math
2. probability theory
3. combinatorics

## Graphs

Contents need to be reviewed in graphs:

### Graph representation

1. objects and pointers
2. adjacency matrix
3. adjacency list

### Functionalities

1. distance
2. search
3. connectivity
4. cycle-detection

### Traversal

1. BFS
2. DFS

## Machine Learning 

(to be decided)
